## What is this?
An API to interact with Phagebook.<br/>
Background: Phagebook is a social/lab networking web app where synthetic biologists can post specific lab projects or order lab stock across labs. For more information, please check out the <a href="http://cidarlab.org/phagebook/">CIDAR Phagebook page</a>.

## Background
If you know already about coroutines or asynchronous programming, feel free to skip the *background*.<br/>
A normal desktop program executes functions/instructions one after another assuming the argument/data are always ready. However, this is not always the case in a networking environment. For example, when a function argument requires data from the server, it may take time to fetch the data before executing the function. This produces code blocking, a pause in the thread between data request signal and data retrieval. Asynchronous programming means to send another request to the server while blocking is happening, so you don't have to wait until the first fetch is completed to request the next data. A good reference for asynchronous programming is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sCu4gEjH5I)Since asynchronous code is executed in a different way from how most people view software execution, a different style of syntax is required. Phagebook API uses asynchronous programming with a websocket, we'll look at the examples to show both asynchronous syntax and the API how-to.

## Installation

### Requirements
+ **Twisted API:** Download to your python3 directory using pip3 `sudo pip3 install twisted` 

+ **websocket-client 0.37.0:** Download to your python3 directory using pip3 `sudo pip3 install websocket-client` 

+ **phagebookAPI.py:** Download the Phagebook API and import it to your module.
    
+ **Install Phagebook:** Follow the instructions outlined [here](https://github.com/CIDARLAB/phagebook/wiki/Getting-Started).

## API
All functions return a modified [Twisted Deferred](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/14.0.1/core/howto/defer.html) called Q_Deferred, inspired by [Kristopher Kowal's Deferred](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promise-creation). It's not important to know what exactly a deferred is, but there are plenty of explanations on what deferred is on the internet. Thus, I won't explain it here. What's important is that when you call any of the API functions, you immediately call `.then()` on it and pass the name of the function you wish to be executed when data is received from server. The callback function may have one argument at maximum, which will be your returned data. It's important to read the [Q Promise Reference](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference) to understand how to use the API.
